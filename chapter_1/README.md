# Chapter 1

This [repository] [rep] was created for learning Python with **'Python Crash Course 
a hands-on, Project-Based introduction to Programming'** *2nd edition by Eric Matthes*, so lets beggin, shall we?

## 'Hello World' code

During the Chapter 1 Author propose us to run banal, but yet working, example of code: 

```sh
print('Hello Python World!')
```

## Exercises aka. Hometask

This part will contain the essencial hometasks from Chapter 1.

### Exercise 1-1

The case is for the student to find something interesting on [python.org].

Me personally find this list *particulary* useful:
| Page | Description |
| ------ | ------|
| [Python for Non-Programmers](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers)| Contains a bunch of materials, sites, books etc. for Python Beginners |
| [Python related info in Ukrainian](https://wiki.python.org/moin/UkranianLanguage)| Some refferences where you can find information about Python in Ukrainian |
| [Begginer's guide to Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide) | This guide will help you to get started quickly |

### Exercise 1-2

>Can you make a typo that generates an error?

Yes, it is possible to make a typo into a function and syntaxis it requires. For example, i can misspell the function, forget to close the parentheses or use different type of quotation marks.

>Can you make sense of the error message?

Yes, it is easy to navigate with errors with using mighty Google Search.

>Can you make a typo that doesn’t generate an error?

It is possible, but in that particular case only inside quotation marks (or better to say 'into the printing text' or 'into the object of the function').

>Why do you think it didn’t make an error?

If error didn't occur, it means that typo wasn't conflicting with the syntaxis of the function or language.

### Exercise 1-3

So far the hardest task, because the student need to use some real imagination. 

1. Program for making NCSREPU monthly reports.
This program will create, rename and fullfill the .xlsx files. The necessary data will be taken from another .xlsx files with unique names, that are downloaded monthly.

2. *Chapter is in progress...*
3. *Chapter is in progress...*
